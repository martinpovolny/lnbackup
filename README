Lnbackup is a hardlink backup system for hard drives. 

Lnbackup operates in a way similar to the '--link-dest' switch in rsync.

It creates incremental backups using hardlinks so that each backup seems like a full backup. Additionaly it can make (using hardlinks) bootable mirror from the latest backup.

Obviously the target filesystem of lnbackup needs to support hardlinks.

It's run on ~200 servers for several years and it is considered stable.

Read the man page for more information.
